            <li>2 (.25 ounce) envelopes FLEISCHMANN'S® Pizza Crust Yeast or RapidRise® Yeast</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1 ⅓ cups very warm water (120 degrees F to 130 degrees F)</li>
            <li>⅓ cup oil</li>
            <h3>Toppings</h3>
            <li>1 (6 ounce) package HORMEL® Pepperoni</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, or more to taste</li>
            
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        
        <ol>
            <li>For sauce: Combine all sauce ingredients with 1/2 cup water in a medium bowl; set 
                <br> for flavors to develop while making crust. Freeze remaining paste .</li>
            <li>For crusts: Combine 2 cups of flour with the dry yeast, sugar and salt. Add the water 
                <br>and oil and mix until well blended (about 1 minute). Gradually add enough remaining 
                <br>flour slowly, until a soft, sticky dough ball is formed.</li>
            <li>Knead for about 4 minutes, on a floured surface, until dough is smooth and elastic. 
                <br>Add more flour, if needed. (If using RapidRise® Yeast, let dough rest, covered, for 10 
                <br>minutes.)</li>
            <li>Divide dough in half. Pat each half (with floured hands) into a 12-inch greased pizza 
                <br>pan OR roll dough to fit pans.</li>
            <li>For pizzas: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Top crusts with sauce, pepperoni and 
                <br>cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake for 18 to 20 minutes until crusts are browned and cheese is bubbly. For best 
                <br>results, rotate pizza pans between top and bottom oven racks halfway through 
                <br>baking.</li>
        </ol>
